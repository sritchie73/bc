  <h2>R is...</h2>
  <p class="fragment">
    An environment for performing statistical analysis
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Software for data visualisation

    So for those of you who have never encountered R before, what is it? R is a statistical programming language which is used to:
     - process and analyse data
     - visualise data, and generate publication quality graphics
    It is also a programming language, allowing you to:
     - develop analysis pipelines
     - develop new statistical methods
    It is also a free open-source project, making it completely free to download and extend.

  <h2>Why R and not &lt;X&gt;?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">
    Prepackaged with common statistics and methods
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    If something is missing, there's a package for that!
  </p>
  <ol class="fragment"> 
    <li>5000+ add on packages in CRAN</li>
    <li>800+ on Bioconductor</li>
    <li>100+ on github</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="fragment">
    <strong>Cutting edge</strong>
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    So why use or learn R for data analysis, instead of another language or platform?
    Not only does R come prepackage with pretty much any statistical model or test you can think of,
    but its also easy to extend and install add-on packages. As a result its used by researchers and industry all over the world, 
    not only for their analyses, but also for method development. This means that R is cutting edge, new methods are often available
    in R long before they're implemented in other languages or platforms.
    In November last year, there were more than 5000 statistical and general purpose packages available in CRAN, along with many domain specific
    packages like those specific to life sciences research.

    Software Carpentry is the solution.
    We run intensive two-day classes that give scientists and engineers those fundamental skills
    as part of the <a href="http://mozillascience.org/">Mozilla Science Lab</a>.

    Increase both numbers 50% in 2014.

  <aside class="notes">
    We ran almost 100 two-day workshops for over 3500 people in 2013 alone,
    and hope to increase both numbers by half in 2014.
