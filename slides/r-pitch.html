    So for those of you who have never encountered R before, what is it? R is a statistical programming language which is used to:
     - process and analyse data
     - visualise data, and generate publication quality graphics
    It is also a programming language, allowing you to:
     - develop analysis pipelines
     - develop new statistical methods
    It is also a free open-source project, making it completely free to download and extend.

  <h1>Outcomes</h1>
  <p>
    20% improvement in productivity is common.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    10X isn't rare.
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    We can often save people 20% of their time - a day a week -

  <h1>Outcomes</h1>
  <p>
    Empowers people.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    HPC, the cloud, web services, big data, ...
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Reproducible research, open science, ...
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    We also give people the technical skills they need to make use of
    high-performance computing, the cloud, and other new possibilities,
    and to play an active role in changing the way science itself is done.

  <h1>The Details</h1>
  <p>
    Materials are all open access.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Instructors are volunteers.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Only cost is travel and accommodation
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    (but contributions to central costs are welcome).
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    Our notes and examples are all freely reusable under open licenses,
    and our instructors are all volunteers,
    so the only cost to host sites is travel and accommodation
    (though we are grateful for contributions to central costs).
