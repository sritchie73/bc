    So for those of you who have never encountered R before, what is it? R is a statistical programming language which is used to:
     - process and analyse data
     - visualise data, and generate publication quality graphics
    It is also a programming language, allowing you to:
     - develop analysis pipelines
     - develop new statistical methods
    It is also a free open-source project, making it completely free to download and extend.
