At some point I want to create a bioinformatics capstone example using 
the freely available Wallaby Thymus Transcript data I've left in 
`data/bio/`

Data sourced from [ANDS](http://researchdata.ands.org.au/tammar-wallaby-thymus-transcriptomes-dataset/11126)

This should be a ~1hr series of challenges that incorporates all subjects
covered previously in the bootcamp
